# Reference

SQLair is made up of two parts, the domain specific language (DSL) and the function API. The DSL is the special syntax written into your SQL queries that tells SQLair how to map your Go objects to the database inputs and outputs. The API is the functional interface of SQLair. 

To read more about the API, please see our [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/canonical/sqlair).

For more information about the specifics of the DSL see the following:
